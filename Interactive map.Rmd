# Developing Data Products: R Markdown and Leaflet

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

The following interactive map has been developed in leaflet. The marker shows where my office is situated and the circle indicates the region I live in. 

```{r}
library(leaflet)
my_map<-leaflet()
my_map<-my_map%>%addMarkers(my_map, 
                     lng=4.714001574265836, lat=50.87779769012357,
                     popup="My Office")
my_map<-my_map%>%addCircles(my_map,
                lng=4.423233, lat=50.8333451, weight=3, 
                radius=800, popup="The region I live in")
my_map
```
